# Work Plan and Project Initiation Sheet Template for Enterprise Data Engineering, Data Science and ML Projects

### This is an example of a Work Plan that Project Engineers, Project Leads, Managers, Principal Engineers, AI Specialists, Software Engineers, Data Engineers, Data Scientists etc, can use as a template to design work plans and project initiation documents for their projects.

In this fictitious project, BPC Int'l had contacted ABC_&_Co to serve as a consultant that can assist BPC Int'l to develop a machine learning/NLP workload that they can use at BPC Int'l to make chemical/molecules fingerprinting. The project is basically about developing and productionising a ML/NLP model of ChemBERTa (available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09885). ChemBERTa was based on RoBERTa (available at Hugginface: https://huggingface.co/seyonec/ChemBERTa-zinc-base-v1). BPC Int'l has an in-house IT/Cloud team, but they do not have expertise in developing and productionizing ML models. An A_BC_&_Co consultant had been tasked with coming up with a Work Plan/Project Initiation document that can be later developed into a full working/contract document. 

## WorkPlan for ChemBERTa NLP Algorithm Implementation at BPC Int'l
Chemical fingerprinting is used to identify and characterize a substance by analyzing its unique chemical composition. This process essentially creates a "fingerprint" of the substance, thus allowing for comparison to known samples. Chemical fingerprinting enables tasks like materials quality control, source identification, and contaminant detection in various fields like environmental monitoring, food and drug analysis, forensics, molecules analysis and drug discovery to be easily accomplished

ChemBERTa, an adaptation of the popular RoBERTa machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) algorithm has been found to be quite useful for chemical fingerprinting, and molecules properties prediction when trained on the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) data set. SMILES is the world largest open sources collections of chemical and molecules structures. 

Big Pharma Company (BPC) is seeking to leverage its extensive materials data sets and the ChemBERTa algorithm for chemical fingerprinting, molecules identification, molecule representation, and molecules properties prediction.

ABC_&_Co engineers will be able to assist BPC by leveraging ABC_&_Coâ€™s expertise in machine learning, software development and natural language programming processing (NLP) to achieve an implementation of the ChemBERTa algorithm using BPC data.
